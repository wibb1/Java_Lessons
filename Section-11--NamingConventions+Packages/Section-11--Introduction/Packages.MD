# Packages

Some reasons to use Packages are:

* Easier to determine what classes are related
* Easier to find the related code
* Packages create scope/namespace for class and interface names thereby limiting conflicts
* Classes within the package have unrestricted access to each other while restricting access for classes outside the
  package.
*
